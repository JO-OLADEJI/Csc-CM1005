### Implement Extensions:

The next stage is to extend your code by adding up to three of the extensions which are demonstrated in the final topic:

1. Add sounds Use p5.sound to add sound effects to your game. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this. ✅
2. Create platforms Use the factory pattern to create platforms. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this. ✅
3. Create enemies Use a constructor function to create enemies. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this. ✅

It’s up to you how many of the three you implement and to what degree you enhance the implementation from the basic tutorial code. The extension is graded with criteria for functionality, creativity and ambition. If you are unsure, then the grading rubric will guide you on how to scope your extension work.

Deliverables:
Hand in your final game project as a compressed folder in .zip format. It should contain the following.

Your final game project code

All assets needed to run the code (html files, library files, images, sound files etc.)

A commentary of around 250 words in PDF format. This should describe:

your extension(s)

the bits you found difficult

the skills you learnt/practiced in completing the game project
